In this guide, we’ll see how to connect Linen Wallet to Aave to lend or borrow crypto for an interest.

At the end of this guide, you will be able to safely connect to Aave and start earning interest on your crypto. (The same process applies to any other blockchain applications).

## How to Connect Linen Wallet to Aave
Open the Aave website and click on Enter app.

Open your mobile browser again, click on the menu at the top-right as before. As you can see, your Polygon address now appears at the top right.

How to Use Aave
Now that we've seen how to connect to Aave, let's also see how to use Aave to earn interest on our crypto. From the menu, let's click on market.

This is the page where you can find all the available tokens you can deposit or borrow and the interest you can receive or pay.
It is worth noting that, besides the standard interest, you also receive an additional reward in Matic tokens (sponsored by Polygon). For example, if you deposit DAI, you receive 2.73% of interest in DAI tokens plus 1.32% of interest in wMatic tokens for a total of 4.05% (All APRs are variable)

<img src=" ">

Let’s deposit some DAI to earn some interest. Click on the menu at the top-right again and select Deposit.

<img src=" ">

Click on the token you want to deposit (in our case, the DAI token).

<img src=" ">

Input the amount you want to deposit and click on Continue.

<img src=" ">

Review your deposit and click on Deposit.

<img src=" ">

Linen Wallet pops up again so that you can sign the transaction and confirm the deposit. (Every time you want to perform any kind of transaction on a blockchain application, you need to sign that transaction with your wallet.)

<img src=" ">

Let’s wait for our transaction to be processed (it usually takes about a minute.)

<img src=" ">

When the transaction is done, you can see it in the Activity section of your Linen Wallet.

<img src=" ">

As you can see in the Wallet section, we now have 50 DAI less, since they are deposited into Aave.

<img src=" ">

Open your mobile browser again, click on the top-right menu, and select Deposit.

<img src=" ">

Here you can see your deposit growing thanks to the interest you are earning.

<img src=" ">

So what if you want to get your money back after some time? Let’s see how to do that. Click on the top-right menu again and then select My Dashboard.

<img src=" ">

At the very top of the dashboard, you can see the wMatic reward you’ve earned. We’ll see how to withdraw them later. First, let’s withdraw our DAI. Simply click on Withdraw to proceed.

<img src=" ">

Input the amount to withdraw and then click on Continue.

<img src=" ">

Let’s then click on withdraw and sign the transaction using our wallet, which pops up automatically.

<img src=" ">

Click on Confirm to sign and approve the transaction.

<img src=" ">

As always, let’s wait for the transaction to be processed.

<img src=" ">

When the transaction is processed, we can see it in the Activity section of the wallet as we did before.

<img src=" ">

So we have now withdrawn our DAI with the interest earned. We now have the wMatic reward to withdraw too. Let’s open the mobile browser, click on the top-right menu and then select My Dashboard, as we did before.
Here we can see our available reward. Let’s click on Claim to withdraw it.

<img src=" ">

Let’s click again on Claim to make our Linen Wallet pop up and sign our transaction.

<img src=" ">

As we did before, let’s click on Confirm to sign and approve the transaction and withdraw our reward. After the transaction is processed, we will see the reward in our Linen Wallet.
