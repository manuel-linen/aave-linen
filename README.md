How to Use Aave
Now that we've seen how to connect to Aave, let's also see how to use Aave to earn interest on our crypto. From the menu, let's click on market.

This is the page where you can find all the available tokens you can deposit or borrow and the interest you can receive or pay.
It is worth noting that, besides the standard interest, you also receive an additional reward in Matic tokens (sponsored by Polygon). For example, if you deposit DAI, you receive 2.73% of interest in DAI tokens plus 1.32% of interest in wMatic tokens for a total of 4.05% (All APRs are variable)
